# SimpleCalculator
Made a simple Java calculator that will prompt you for two number, then for an operator it will then take that operator and go through a while loop to tell which
operator was chosen and take the numbers you gave it and use the appropriate operator and it will then give you the sum of the proper equation.
If no real operator was chosen it will give you an error that says "There is no proper operator. Try again"
